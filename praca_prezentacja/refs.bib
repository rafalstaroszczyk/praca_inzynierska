ABSTRACT = {Chemo-mechanical phenomena, including oscillations and peristaltic motions, are widespread in nature&mdash;just think of heartbeats&mdash;thanks to the ability of living organisms to convert directly chemical energy into mechanical work. Their imitation with artificial systems is still an open challenge. Chemical clocks and oscillators (such as the popular Belousov&ndash;Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction) are reaction networks characterized by the emergence of peculiar spatiotemporal dynamics. Their application to polymers at interfaces (grafted chains, layer-by-layer assemblies, and polymer brushes) offers great opportunities for developing novel smart biomimetic materials. Despite the wide field of potential applications, limited research has been carried out so far. Here, we aim to showcase the state-of-the-art of this fascinating field of investigation, highlighting the potential for future developments and providing a personal outlook.},

abstract = {Abstract Cellular metabolic demands change throughout the cell cycle. Nevertheless, a characterization of how metabolic fluxes adapt to the changing demands throughout the cell cycle is lacking. Here, we developed a temporal-fluxomics approach to derive a comprehensive and quantitative view of alterations in metabolic fluxes throughout the mammalian cell cycle. This is achieved by combining pulse-chase LC-MS-based isotope tracing in synchronized cell populations with computational deconvolution and metabolic flux modeling. We find that TCA cycle fluxes are rewired as cells progress through the cell cycle with complementary oscillations of glucose versus glutamine-derived fluxes: Oxidation of glucose-derived flux peaks in late G1 phase, while oxidative and reductive glutamine metabolism dominates S phase. These complementary flux oscillations maintain a constant production rate of reducing equivalents and oxidative phosphorylation flux throughout the cell cycle. The shift from glucose to glutamine oxidation in S phase plays an important role in cell cycle progression and cell proliferation.},
